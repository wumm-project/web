    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Transition from a flow with many transformations to a
  homogeneous flow.</skos:definition>
    <skos:example xml:lang="en">An example is a diesel generator and a fuel cell: In a
  diesel generator, the energy flow has the following form:&lt;br/&gt;
  Chemical energy of the fuel -&gt; thermal energy -&gt; mechanical energy -&gt; 
  electrical energy.&lt;br/&gt;
  In a fuel cell, the transformation is only one:&lt;br/&gt;
  Chemical energy of the fuel -&gt; electrical energy.&lt;br/&gt;
  Consequently, the efficiency of a fuel cell is twice as high.</skos:example>
    <skos:note xml:lang="en">Usually, every transformation of a flo (transfer of substances
  from one state to another, the change of types of energy, the change in the
  way information is represented) is accompanied by losses and inhibition.
  Consequently, reducing the number of such transformations leads to an
  increase in conductivity. Ideally, there should be no transformations at
  all, and all components of flows should immediately have the form necessary
  for their final use.</skos:note>

    <skos:example xml:lang="en">An example is the drill. In the past, the drill was driven
  by a stationary motor through a flexible gear, or even a system of
  gears.&lt;br/&gt; The long mechanical energy flow imposed limits on the speed of
  rotation of the drill, which reduced productivity and increased suffering of
  the patient. In today's systems, the source of rotation is located in the

    <skos:example xml:lang="en">As an example from another field, it is a well-known fact to
  all militaries that highly stretched communications have an extremely
  detrimental effect on troop supply, so reduced communications (i.e. shorter
  equipment flow lengths) is a constant headache for strategists.</skos:example>
    <skos:note xml:lang="en">Usually, many types of losses and resistances to a flow are

  present and to target the trawl.</skos:example>
    <skos:note xml:lang="en">Since flow behaviour in the grey zone cannot be predicted, the
  parameters of these areas are usually chosen empirically. It is not always

  lubrication, which naturally leads to increased wear. As you can see, there
