== Description ==

A collection of WP shortcodes, one per file, to create different views on the
RDF database of LIFIS for its Wordpress site.

Each shortcode is defined in a separate PHP file that ends with a shortcode
declaration and an outcommented test and can be operated standalone from the
comand line. 

All shortcodes are collected in the main.php by include statements and thus can
easily be switched on or off. 

== Installation and Configuration ==

Copy this directory as subdirectory to the plugin dir of the WP site. 
At the moment no configuration required.
